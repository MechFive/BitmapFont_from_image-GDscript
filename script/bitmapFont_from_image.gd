# script for creating monospaced bitmap fonts from texture.
# tested in Godot 3.0.6 and 3.0.5
#
# attach this script to Node and fill the Font Texture field with the texture you
# want to create.
#
# you need to write a [texture_name].kmp file (example below) in same
# folder with the texture you wish to convert.
#
# You can now run the script and you should have bitmap font resource of your 
# texture in the same folder with your texture after script finishes.
#
# You can tweak your texture and reimport the texture and the font resource will
# update without having to run this script again (unless you add characters or
# change the cell they are).
#
# NOTE: this script is meant to be used as a custom importer for bitmap font so it
# is not recommeded to run it unless you need to create or modify that resource.
#
######################### [texture_name].kmp ########################################
#
# lines beginning with # are regardeds as comments and will be ignored.
# empty lines are ignored also.
#
# first non comment or non empty line is for texture size x and y accordingly.
# then type the symbols as they appear in your texture.
# do line break for next row, ignore empty cells (if any) in your texture.
# save this file as [texture_name].kmp in same folder as your texture.
#
# NOTE: dont make #(hashtag) symbol in the first cell of any row in
# your texture, because this file would dismiss that row as a comment.
#
# Example file [texture_name].kmp
